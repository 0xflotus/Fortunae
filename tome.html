      <h2># General Setup</h2>
      <p>
        You should decide between whether you are tracking your finances weekly
        or monthly and adhere to this. Each record will reperesent that time
        frame and it will make record keeping dependable.
      </p>
      <h2>## Recommendations</h2>
      <p>
        Recommendations algorithm sums all sources of income for the time period
        specified.
      </p>

      <p>
        If combined total of Savings and Emergency Fund is greater than or equal
        to 3x the Income on your record, you're given a recommendation of
        Spending 60%, Saving 30%, and Investing 10%.
      </p>

      <p>
        If combined total of Savings and Emergency Fund is less than or equal to
        3x the Income on your record, you're given a recommendation to Spend
        60%, and add 40% to an Emergency Fund. For tracking purposes, these
        funds can be added to a Savings Fund or an Emergency Fund.
      </p>
      <h2>## Overview of Terminology</h2>

      <p></p>
      <h3></h3>

      <h3>## Funds</h3>

      <p>
        Each item that is added to funds should represent an account that is
        used for spending. There are four categories of accounts: Checking,
        Saving, Investment, Emergency. For tracking purposes each category of
        account rolls up to a grand total. If you have two savings accounts, you
        will see a grand total in the charts.
      </p>

      <h3>## Expenses</h3>
      <p>
        Each item that is added as an expense should get a category of expense.
        All expense categories roll up to grand totals in their respective
        categories. If you have three items that you categorize as a "Food"
        expense, the grand total will display the sum of these expenses.
      </p>
      <h3>## Debts</h3>
      <p>
        Each item that is added as a debt should get a debt category. There are
        four general categories of debts: Secured, Unsecured, Revolving,
        Non-Revolving.
      </p>
      <h4>### Secured (Investopedia df.)</h4>
      <p>
        Secured debt is debt backed or secured by collateral to reduce the risk
        associated with lending, such as a mortgage. If the borrower defaults on
        repayment, the bank seizes the house, sells it and uses the proceeds to
        pay back the debt. Assets backing debt or a debt instrument are
        considered security, which is why unsecured debt is considered a riskier
        investment than secured debt.
      </p>
      <p>
        The most commonly cited example of a secured loan is a mortgage. Other
        examples include the service provided by pawnshops or the factoring of
        receivables.
      </p>

      <h4>### Unsecured (Investopedia df.)</h4>
      <p>
        Unsecured debt refers to loans that are not backed by collateral. If the
        borrower defaults on the loan, the lender may not be able to recover
        their investment because the borrower is not required to pledge any
        specific assets as security for the loan.
      </p>
      <p>
        Examples of unsecured debt include credit cards, medical bills, utility
        bills, and other instances in which credit was given without any
        collateral requirement.
      </p>

      <h4>### Revolving (Investopedia df.)</h4>
      <p>
        Revolving credit refers to a situation where credit replenishes up to
        the agreed upon threshold, known as the credit limit, as the customer
        pays off debt. It offers the customer access to money from a financial
        institution and allows the customer to use the funds when needed. It
        usually is used for operating purposes and the amount drawn can
        fluctuate each month depending on the customer's current cash flow
        needs.
      </p>
      <p>
        Revolving credit may take the form of credit cards or lines of credit.
        Revolving lines of credit can be taken out by corporations or
        individuals. It may be offered as a facility.
      </p>
      <h4>### Non-Revolving (Investopedia df.)</h4>
      <p>
        Non-revolving loans are often an option for borrowers seeking to make
        large purchases or consolidate their debt. They can be used for buying a
        car or buying a home for example. In these situations, the loan is also
        secured with collateral which is an added benefit for a non-revolving
        loan.
      </p>
      <p>
        In a non-revolving loan, the borrower receives a maximum principal
        amount in a lump sum upfront when the borrower is approved for the loan.
        These loans have a specified duration which will vary by the type of
        credit product. Non-revolving loans also typically require monthly
        installment payments and will generally have interest rates in a similar
        range to revolving credit.
      </p>

      <h3>## Incomes</h3>
      <p>
        Each item that is added as an income should reflect the income for that
        period of time. If you are tracking weekly finanances and add a salary,
        it will be the salary for the week (after taxes). If you hare tracking
        monthly finances and add a salary, it will be the salary for the month
        (after taxes). Types of income include Active, Passive, and Portfolio.
      </p>

      <h4>### Active (Investopedia df.)</h4>
      <p>
        Active income refers to income received from performing a service and
        includes wages, tips, salaries, commissions, and income from businesses
        in which there is material participation. An accountant who works for a
        monthly paycheck, for example, receives active income.
      </p>
      <h4>### Passive (Investopedia df.)</h4>
      <p>
        Passive income is earnings derived from a rental property, limited
        partnership, or other enterprise in which a person is not actively
        involved. As with active income, passive income is usually taxable.
        However, it is often treated differently by the Internal Revenue Service
        (IRS). Portfolio income is considered passive income by some analysts,
        so dividends and interest would therefore be considered passive.
        However, the IRS does not always agree that portfolio income is passive,
        so itâ€™s wise to check with a tax professional on that subject.
      </p>
      <h4>### Portfolio (Investopedia df.)</h4>
      <p>
        Portfolio income is money received from investments, dividends,
        interest, and capital gains. Royalties received from investment property
        also are considered portfolio income sources.
